 Q. Why do i need to make a new programming language, when there already exists many?
 But thats not the point. Why does it matter to me at all? What will happen when i make
 one? Will i be able to make my parents happier by doing it? What will happen?

- Recognition, Respect
- Education becomes simpler
- Help people and me to quickly grow
- Use of software gets more standardized
- Help me write all the programs for my startup
- Help make my parents proud, happy, and confident

It will help make all magic things possible through technology. Virtual-reality, Augmented-
reality, unified communications, hand computer, internet of things and what not.

Low-level features
A mid-level programming close to C++ that allows one to write low-level code, and hence
can be used in place of any assembly language code.

High-level features
Yet, it should be one where it should be possible to write extremely large applications
without much increase in complexity. 

High-speed partial compile
Allowing the computer to paraphrase the progress and logic of a program in the best possible
way, thus enhancing productivity, and allow computer science to be converted into a field of
communication to computers and expression of logic.

Direct Public Sharing
All public code will be automatically shared with the world as soon as it is written and also
when it is tested with details test and automatic performace results. Code already developed
can be easily imported by automtically by the ide from the internet.

Simpler importing
No need to write entire namespace path. It will automatically be resolved by the compiler.

Simpler expression of logic


Style creation and usage


All initialization code can be specified at multiple places, so with termination code.
Obviously a general and natural way of doing things would be the best.

Is there any difference between a variable and a constant, or at least between a function
and a constant.

Variable access properties vs function (getters and setters).
