Advantages of C
===============

1. Speed of resulting application.
2. Language set is small and very efficient.
3. Application in Firmware programming.
4. Ability to use assembly in it.
5. Direct communication with devices.
6. Very easy to learn.
7. Compiler-based rather than interpreter-based.
8. It is portable.
9. Has a huge collection of libraries.
10. Does not support exception handling.


Disadvantages of C
==================
1. Does not have OOPS feature.
2. No runtime checking.
3. No strict type checking.
4. It is case sensitive.
5. 


The first and foremost for any language is its syntax, and it must be beautiful. It is required to choose which domain the program would work for.
My domain is modelling all languages hence is a general programming language, a way of specifying logic that would work in all areas/

List of languages i want to combine:
Java, C, C++, C#, ASM, BASIC, SQL
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP
Python, Ruby, Perl
Embedded C, C++, ASM
VHDL, Verilog
...

List of architectures i want to combine:
x86, IA-32 (x86-32), AMD64 (x86-64), Intel 64
Motorola 6800, 68000
MOS Technology 6502
Zilog Z80
Power Architecture
ARM, ARM64
Renesas RX CPU
...

Abstract logic specification is required so that a specified logic can be programmed into any architecture without any modification to the original source code.
Not only should the logic be abstract but also concurrent in time and space.
